An image file is to be transferred from the Server end to the Client end. This time the transfer of data has to be in bulk. This is achieved using ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream classes. A byte array is employed for storing the data in bulk, followed by transfer of this bulk of data to the Client end. The empty JPEG file at the Client end is used to store the data received from the Server end.
